The gentle ember lights the dark
From the kindling you made in 
The tender flame
Melts the snow on the trees

The Christmas glow, the icey park
And the winter that's come to be
It's the season of joy
But I cannot be happy

Is it all because of

The times we were talking
Both walking
The clock slowing down
All the fears 
We're hiding 
Come open and ... out

All the moments
The gossips
The secret we hold
The laughter
The fun and 
the words we have told
...we have told

All the lies I say unfold
If there's one thing that's true.
CENSORED
I love you.
